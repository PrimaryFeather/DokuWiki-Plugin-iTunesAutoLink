# iTunes Auto Link Maker Plugin for DokuWiki #

This plugin is for members of the iTunes Affiliate Program.
It automatically converts any iTunes or AppStore link to an affiliate link, using the official JS-script provided by Apple.

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
`lib/plugins/itunesautolink/` - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
